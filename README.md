# U-Net Model Implementation with TensorFlow on Pet Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`ipynb`) that demonstrates the implementation of a U-Net model using TensorFlow. The model is trained on the Pet Dataset from TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS), which consists of images of cats and dogs. The notebook preprocesses the images by resizing them to 128x128 pixels to match the input size expected by the U-Net model.

## Usage

To use this notebook:

1. Download the `ipynb` file.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
3. Run all cells sequentially.

This will execute the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the images, defining the U-Net model architecture, training the model, and evaluating its performance. Feel free to customize the notebook for your specific datasets or experiment with different model configurations.

## Requirements

- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS)
- Jupyter Notebook
